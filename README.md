# Strange Security

Welcome to Strange Security, a website dedicated to exploring the strangeness of security in the world of cyber security. As a recent OSCP certified student, I am constantly striving to improve my skills and knowledge in the field by regularly practicing on platforms like HackTheBox and TryHackMe.

On this website, you will find blog posts covering various topics related to cyber security, including walkthroughs, tutorials, and general musings. I hope that my content will inspire others to also explore the fascinating world of security and join me on this journey.
